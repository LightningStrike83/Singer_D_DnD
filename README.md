# DnD Crushing Bugs 

Solving bugs for the dungeons and dragons puzzle board. Two main issues were found:  
-More than one piece can be placed in an area at one given time.  
-When the background image changes, the puzzle pieces are not reset back to their original positions.  

The task is to solve these bugs and potentially find a solution to a third optional bug:  
-When the background image changes, the puzzle pieces do not change to reflect the new puzzle board.
